Requires Unity 5.0 or higher. Currently supports Windows, OSX, and Linux builds - more platforms soon once they've been tested more thoroughly.

### Install

Either [download the latest released Unity Package][release] and import it into your project OR [download the zip][download] of this repository and extract its contents into your Unity project's Assets directory.

You may also want to download some of the available BuildAction modules in the [Unity-Build-Actions][unitybuild-actions] repository to expand SuperUnityBuild's capabilities.
